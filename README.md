# classification_images
The goal of this project is to classify many images (0: Building, 1: forest, 2: glacier, 3: mountain, 4: sea, 5: street).
Several machine learning algorithms have been deployed for this purpose. Performance measures were used to compare the different algorithms and to choose at the end the one that allows to do the classification well
